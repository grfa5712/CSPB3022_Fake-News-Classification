# CSPB3022 - Fake News Classification

### By Grant Fairbairn


Welcome to my Fake News Classification project for CSPB 3022 for the Fall 2022 semester. 


### Project Topic and Goal

The phrase "fake news" refers to news articles that are intentionally and verifiably false. Fake news articles have become ubiquitous in American politics and culture in the last 10 years. It is tempting to believe it is a new phenomon, unique to our times. But fake news has a long and sometimes brutal history. We can document examples as far back as 15th century Italy.

What's changed is the speed at which fake news now spreads via the Internet. Social media platforms are particularly problematic, as people can curate a list of likeminded "friends" and create a form of echo chamber where rumors and otherwise laughably false information is repeated until it is accepted as fact.

My goal with this project was to use classification techniques on two datasets containing fake and real news entries to train models to predict whether an article presented fake or real news.


### Data Source and Description

The data for this report was found on Kaggle. I was looking for something timely, and with the onslaught of political news swirling around social media platforms due to the mid-term elections in November 2022, this data set jumped out.  


### Code and Video Presentation

My code for the project is located in the Python file in this repository entitled "CSPB3022_Final_Project.ipynb".

The datasets Fake.csv and True.csv are available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv. They were too large to load directly into this repository.
